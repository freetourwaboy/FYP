Generating a QR code without using a library is a complex process, as it involves many steps, including data encoding, error correction, data placement, and masking. Here's a high-level overview of the process:

Choose the optimal encoding mode: QR codes support several encoding modes, including Numeric, Alphanumeric, Byte, and Kanji. Select the encoding mode that best fits the data you want to encode.

Determine the QR code version: QR codes have 40 different versions, which vary in size and data capacity. Based on the amount of data you want to store and the chosen encoding mode, select the appropriate QR code version.

Divide and encode the input data: Divide your input data into segments based on the chosen encoding mode, and then convert each segment into a bit stream.

Add terminator and padding bits: Add a terminator to the bit stream, if necessary, to signify the end of the data. Then, add padding bits to ensure that the final bit stream meets the required length for the chosen QR code version.

Apply error correction: QR codes use Reed-Solomon error correction to ensure the data can still be read even if the QR code is partially damaged. Calculate and add the error correction codewords to the data bit stream.

Create and initialize the QR code matrix: Depending on the version, create an empty matrix of the appropriate size, and add the function patterns (such as finder patterns, timing patterns, alignment patterns, and format information areas) to the matrix.

Place the data and error correction codewords: Place the data and error correction codewords in the QR code matrix using a specific pattern that zig-zags upward and downward.

Add format and version information: Calculate and add the format information (which includes the error correction level and the mask pattern) to the matrix. For QR code versions 7 and higher, also add the version information to the matrix.

Apply a masking pattern: Choose the best mask pattern from the available 8 mask patterns to minimize the risk of misreads or scanning failures. Apply the chosen mask pattern to the matrix.

Render the QR code: Finally, render the QR code as an image or another visual representation using the matrix data. The image can be in any format, such as PNG, JPEG, or SVG.

While this high-level overview covers the main steps of QR code generation, the actual implementation requires a deep understanding of the QR code specification (ISO/IEC 18004) and involves many detailed algorithms and calculations. Implementing QR code generation from scratch is a challenging task, so it's recommended to use a library or an existing QR code generator when possible.






QR codes come in 40 different versions, each with a different size and data capacity. The primary difference between the versions is the number of modules (small squares) that make up the QR code. The size of a QR code is calculated as (17 + 4 * version) modules on each side. Version 1 QR codes are 21x21 modules, and the size increases by 4 modules per version, up to version 40, which has a size of 177x177 modules.

The data capacity of a QR code depends on the version and the error correction level (L, M, Q, or H). Higher versions can store more data, but they also result in larger and more complex QR codes that may be harder to scan. The error correction level affects data capacity as well, with higher error correction levels providing more robustness against damage at the cost of reduced data capacity.

The most common QR code version depends on the specific use case and the amount of data being encoded. Generally, lower version QR codes (such as versions 1 to 4) are more common because they are smaller and easier to scan, while still providing enough data capacity for many applications, such as URLs, contact information, or short text.

When generating a QR code, it's essential to choose the smallest possible version that can accommodate the input data and desired error correction level. This choice ensures that the QR code is as compact as possible while still being able to store the required information.
